        Hello! My name is KÃ¡roly Simon. I have finished a Frontend Training in
        2022, at Ruander Education Center. I spend several hours with
        self-education daily. I am currently learning React-, and Tailwind CSS
        framework. I look forward to opportunities where I can expand my
        knowledge.
